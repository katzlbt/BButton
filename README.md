#BButton 2.0 Forked

BButton is a subclass of UIButton that looks like the [Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) buttons.
BBIconLabel is a new class to display Icons without button. With a single method call it can be set up to convert entered text in InterfaceBuilder to Icons and scale them. No need to write code.

### Changes
* Refactored to be able to use Icomoon Font or any other Font in Buttons.
* Switched from Arrays to memory friendier #define structure.
* Deprecated NSString extensions
* TODO: Draw icon separately of text as this thinns the label font from bold to regular (and loose the ability to display 2+ icons?)
* Addedd BBIconLabel class
