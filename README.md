#iOS-BootstrapButton-Demo

This is XCode5 Project Demo Wrapper for iOS-BootstrapButton, which is included as subproject.
The subproject architecture prevents importing Xcode and screenshot resources to your target project.

BButton is a subclass of UIButton that looks like the [Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) buttons.
